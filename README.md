# jisho-san, yonde(hanashite) kudasai!

This is a WIP Chrome extension that reads some Japanese from jisho.org

### To use:
This is in no way really any use, but if you want to give it a go, pull the repo open `chrome://extensions` and then `Load unpacked extension...`.

To _actually_ use it, navigate to jisho.org, search for a word, and then hit the ðŸ—£ to a word or sentence being read!
